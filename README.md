## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics. As a recent college graduate, I'm actively exploring opportunities in data science, software development, and AI research. Hereâ€™s a look into my key interests and projects:

### Key Interests and Projects

- **Mathematics and Data Science**: My academic background is rich in mathematics and data science. I enjoy leveraging mathematical concepts to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. My research and projects often revolve around data analysis, algorithm development, and machine learning.

- **[Data Preparation Tool](https://github.com/williamdwinnell/task_zero)**: I developed a comprehensive data preparation tool designed to streamline the data cleaning and preprocessing workflow. This tool aims to assist data scientists and analysts in handling large datasets more efficiently, ensuring high-quality data for analysis and model training.

- **[Human-like Chess Engine with Q-LoRA](https://github.com/williamdwinnell/CapstoneChess)**: One of my notable projects is a chess engine that mimics human-like decision-making using Q-LoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). Using chess data from lichess, the language model was trained to predict the next human move given a position and the legal moves available.

- **[A Spanish Language Tutor](https://github.com/williamdwinnell/SpanAIsh)**: A project designed to teach Spanish students using a language model and the socratic method. My simple transformer code was used to train a model to help teach sentence forming skills as well, using the Big Spanish dataset on Huggingface. The project was tested in class, and showed that students learned at a faster pace using our tool versus using only the textbook.
