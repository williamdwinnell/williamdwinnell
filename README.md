## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a strong foundation in computer science and mathematics. As a recent college graduate, I'm actively exploring opportunities in data science, software development, and AI research. Hereâ€™s a look into my key interests and projects:

### Key Interests and Projects

- **Mathematics and Data Science**: My academic background is rich in mathematics and data science. I enjoy leveraging mathematical concepts to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. My research and projects often revolve around data analysis, algorithm development, and machine learning.

- **[Data Preparation Tool]([https://github.com/williamdwinnell/task_zero])**: I developed a comprehensive data preparation tool designed to streamline the data cleaning and preprocessing workflow. This tool aims to assist data scientists and analysts in handling large datasets more efficiently, ensuring high-quality data for analysis and model training.

- **[Human-like Chess Engine with Q-LoRA]([https://github.com/yourusername/chess-engine-q-lora])**: One of my notable projects is a chess engine that mimics human-like decision-making using Q-LoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation). This engine employs advanced reinforcement learning techniques to learn and adapt its strategies, providing a challenging and realistic experience for players.

### Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C, C++, C#
- **Data Science Tools**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
